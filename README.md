# Opex

Opex is an opensource aquarium controller that uses affordable and easily accessible components such as the raspberry-pi, arduino, and other components frequently found on adafruit. The objective of this project is to create a modular, affordable, DIY aquarium controller to monitor, automate, and simplify maintanence of your aquarium similar to the level of other consumer level controllers. The project consists of a two part system: a cloud/web based monitoring, controller, and backup, as well as an all-in-one physical controller to run and manage your tank(s) when offline.
